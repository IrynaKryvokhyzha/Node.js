        melody. Their songs like <span class="highlight">"Hey Jude"</span>,
        <span class="highlight">"Let It Be"</span>, and
        <span class="highlight">"Come Together"</span> are timeless classics
        that never get old. Each member brought something unique to the band,
        creating a sound that was innovative and groundbreaking.
