      <h1>My Favorite Coffee Shop</h1>
      <p>
        My favorite coffee shop is called
        <span class="highlight">"Coffee Haven"</span>. It’s located in the heart
        of the city, and it’s the perfect place to relax, work, or meet friends
        over a delicious cup of coffee.
      </p>

      <h2>What Makes It Special</h2>
      <p>
        The ambiance is warm and cozy with soft lighting and comfortable
        seating. They offer a wide variety of coffee, from classic espressos to
        more unique blends like their signature
        <span class="highlight">Caramel Macchiato</span>. The baristas are
        friendly and always make you feel welcome.
      </p>

      <h2>My Favorite Drink</h2>
      <p>
        Whenever I visit, I always order their
        <span class="highlight">Cappuccino</span>. It has the perfect balance of
        espresso and frothy milk, and it’s always made just the way I like it.
      </p>

      <h2>Location</h2>
      <p>
        The shop is located at <span class="highlight">123 Coffee Street</span>,
        and it’s open from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day. It’s the perfect spot
        to start my morning or unwind in the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're ever in the area, I highly recommend stopping by and enjoying
        a cup of coffee at "Coffee Haven".
